# Node.js - Algorithms - Bubble Sort

* the BubbleSort algorithm
  - recursively calls itself and sorts the last most element through every cycle
  - it compares pairs of elements and swaps them based on size
  - with every cycle it should sort n - 1 (n being the length of the array as the initial)
